Syntax:

  hbmk2 [options] [<script[s]>] <src[s][.prg|.c|.obj|.o|.rc|.res|.def|.po|.pot|.hbl|@.clp|.d|.ch]>

Options:

  -o<outname>         output file name
  -l<libname>         link with <libname> library. <libname> should be without
                      path, extension and 'lib' prefix (unless part of the
                      name). Do not add core Harbour libraries, they are
                      automatically added as needed. If <libname> starts with a
                      '-' character, the library will be removed from the list
                      of libraries at link time.
  -L<libpath>         additional path to search for libraries
  -i<p>|-incpath=<p>  additional path to search for headers
  -static|-shared     link with static/shared libs
  -gt<name>           link with GT<name> GT driver, can be repeated to link
                      with more GTs. First one will be the default at run-time
  -inc[-]             enable/disable incremental build mode (default: disabled)
  -hbexe              create executable (default)
  -hblib              create static library
  -hbdyn              create dynamic library (without linked Harbour VM)
  -hbdynvm            create dynamic library (with linked Harbour VM)
  -help               more help
